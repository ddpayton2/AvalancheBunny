## Division of Labor

We divided our labor based on user stories that players would want to see when playing `Avalanche Bunny`.
Daniel Payton working on the spawning of the falling blocks as well as the rising water level that can kill the player. Josh Mooshian created the blocks the fall so that they vary in size. He also implemented the block physics so that they do not collide with each other upon spawning. Along with this he also implemented the code so that they would stop moving when they hit another block and would no longer kill the player if they were stopped. Ian Pemberton created all Menu screens as well as implemented all audio to the game. Michael Bratton Handled the creation of the rabbit controller and implimented the jumping, ledge climbing, and wall jumping. And also cleaned up file names and fixed the ToImport Folder.
